## üìù Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL for querying and Power BI for data visualization. The dataset includes key information about sales transactions, such as product details, customer demographics, sales dates, and financial information.

Using  SQL queries, I explored, filtered, and aggregated data to uncover valuable insights that can drive business decisions. The visualizations built with Power BI help present these insights in a clear and actionable way.



## ‚ùì Problem Statement
The goal of this project was to perform a detailed analysis of the company's sales data to answer the following business questions:

1. **Top-Selling Products**: Which products generate the most revenue?
2. **Customer Behavior**: What are the purchase habits of customers? Are there any patterns based on gender, product category, or region?
3. **Geographical Insights**: Which countries are contributing the most to sales, and where can we focus marketing efforts?
4. **Sales Trends**: What are the seasonal or monthly sales trends, and how can we optimize stock for peak sales periods?
5. **Order Fulfillment**: Are there any patterns in the order status (e.g., incomplete or undelivered orders) that could indicate operational inefficiencies?

Through a combination of SQL queries for data exploration and aggregation, and Power BI visualizations, these questions were addressed in a comprehensive analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Gained
As someone who is still new to the field of data analysis, this project has been an important learning experience in developing both SQL querying skills and Power BI visualizations. Here's what I learned:

### üñ•Ô∏è SQL Skills:
- **Data Exploration**: Learning how to explore and understand datasets using SQL, from basic queries to advanced data retrieval techniques.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Gained hands-on experience with SQL functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, and `AVG()`, which allowed me to analyze sales data and measure customer behavior.
- **Filtering and Conditional Queries**: Improved my ability to filter and refine large datasets using `WHERE` clauses to draw specific insights based on conditions like gender, region, or product category.
- **Grouping and Ordering**: Learned to group and order data effectively using `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` for analyzing trends and patterns in sales performance.
- **Joins and Subqueries**: Mastered the art of joining tables and writing subqueries to connect different parts of the dataset, enabling more comprehensive analysis.
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Developed advanced skills in writing SQL queries to rank items, calculate percentages, and work with window functions, which will be beneficial in future projects.

### üìä Power BI Skills:
- **Data Visualization**: Learned to create clear, meaningful visualizations that bring data to life using charts, graphs, and maps.
- **Custom Measures**: Built custom measures in Power BI to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales and average order value.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Gained experience in building interactive dashboards that allow users to filter data dynamically by various factors like product category, country, or time period.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Used map visualizations in Power BI to explore sales performance across different geographical regions.
- **Slicers and Filters**: Added slicers and dynamic filters to enable real-time data manipulation, helping users focus on specific subsets of the data quickly and easily.

## üé• Dashboard Video Walkthrough

 To give a clearer understanding of the insights generated in the project, I‚Äôve created a video walkthrough of the Power BI dashboard. The video highlights the key features, visualizations, and insights derived from the dataset, showing how to interact with the dashboard in real-time.

You can watch the video here: [Video Link](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbf99871-fbdb-47f6-a8ca-77223b954654)

In the video, I walk through:
- The **sales performance** by product category, showcasing top-selling items.
- A **map visualization** displaying sales distribution across different countries.
- The **customer spending analysis** based on gender and product preferences.
- **Order status breakdown** showing the percentage of orders delivered, incomplete, or not delivered.

This walkthrough demonstrates how the dashboard can be used for interactive analysis and how it provides actionable insights for decision-makers.


## üöÄ Personal Growth and Future Goals:
This project has been an exciting challenge as I build my foundation in SQL and Power BI. I see this Sales Analysis project as just the beginning of my journey into the world of data analysis. In the future, I aim to:

1. **Work on More Complex Projects**: Tackle more data-intensive projects that require deeper analytical thinking, such as customer segmentation or predictive analytics.
2. **Expand My Technical Skills**: Continue to learn new tools, techniques, and technologies related to data analysis, such as Python for data manipulation, more advanced SQL concepts, or even cloud-based analytics tools.
3. **Gain Professional Experience**: Apply the skills I‚Äôve gained in this project to real-world business problems and further refine my data storytelling abilities through various other projects.
4. **Enhance My Visualization Skills**: Work on more sophisticated Power BI dashboards, integrating other tools and data sources, and explore best practices for UX design in data presentations.

This project has taught me how to approach data problems methodically, and I look forward to deepening my knowledge through continued practice and experimentation.
